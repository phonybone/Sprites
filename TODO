Mapping:
Want drag n drop for big maps
- Requires better mouse events handler
- Retain size of viewing window, size of screen; 
- only copy active portion of background to playing field once per cycle; use semaphor types to control acces
- better yet, always draw to next frame pending, draw active frame once; hopefully no lag issues....

- Need java implementation of antpath

- Need graphing class (possibly easier to roll own?  Seems stupid)
